**Local Mean Time (LMT)** and **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)** are fundamental concepts for air navigation. Understanding how the Earth's rotation affects time at different points on the globe is essential for any pilot. This article explains these concepts in a simple way, based on pilot theory.

## What is Universal Time and Local Mean Time?

To coordinate time globally, **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)** is used. This system describes the local mean time at the 0° meridian (Greenwich Meridian). It is the standard reference used worldwide to avoid confusion between different time zones.

On the other hand, **Local Mean Time (LMT)** is the mean solar time at a specific meridian of longitude. It is defined such that, on average, sunset would occur at 12:00 (noon) at that exact meridian. Unlike legal times that cover wide zones, LMT is specific to each degree of longitude.

## The 15-Degree Rule

The basis of all time calculations in aviation is the Earth's rotation. The Earth rotates 360° in 24 hours. This gives us a key relationship:

*   **15° of longitude = 1 hour** of time difference.
*   **1° of longitude = 4 minutes** of difference.

Since the Earth rotates from West to East, time toward the **East** is always ahead (later) than time toward the **West**.

### LMT Calculation
To calculate the LMT at any location, we simply calculate the difference with respect to Greenwich:
*   If the longitude is **East (E)**, the LMT will be **later** than UTC (time is added).
*   If the longitude is **West (W)**, the LMT will be **earlier** than UTC (time is subtracted).

**Example:**
At a longitude of 110°45' West, the difference is 7 hours and 23 minutes (110.75° / 15°). Since it is West, the LMT is 7h 23m earlier than UTC.

## Global Navigation: The International Date Line

When circumnavigating the globe, adjusting the clock by hours is not enough; eventually, the date must be adjusted. The **International Date Line (IDL)** is located approximately at the 180° meridian.

The rules for crossing this line are:
*   **Traveling West** (e.g., from the U.S. to Australia): **Add one day** (if it's January 1, you move to January 2).
*   **Traveling East** (e.g., from Asia to the U.S.): **Subtract one day** (you gain a day on the calendar).

It is essential to remember: **Westward you add, eastward you subtract**.

## Apparent Solar Time vs. Mean Solar Time

It is important to distinguish between what we see and what we measure:
*   **Apparent Solar Time:** It is the most obvious measure, based on the current position of the sun in the sky. Because the Earth's orbit is not perfectly circular and its axis is tilted, the duration of the actual solar day varies.
*   **Mean Solar Time:** To have constant-length days (24 hours), we use a "mean sun" that moves at constant speed.

This difference and the variations in day and night duration are due to the **Ecliptic**: the apparent path of the sun that is tilted **23.5°** with respect to the Earth's equator.

## Standard Time (ST) and Flight Calculations

**Standard Time (ST)** is the legal or official time of a region, which differs from the exact LMT. For pilots, it is crucial to convert everything to UTC for flight planning.

**Basic Conversion Formula:**
*   `UTC = Standard Time (ST) +/- Zone Difference`

To calculate the duration of a flight or the arrival time before sunset, departure and arrival times must always be converted to UTC, perform the subtraction to obtain flight time, and then convert back to LMT if necessary to determine local sunlight.

### Arc to Time Conversion Summary
*   360° = 24 hours
*   15° = 1 hour
*   1° = 4 minutes
*   1' = 4 seconds

Remembering these equivalences allows for quick and accurate calculations of position and time in flight.
