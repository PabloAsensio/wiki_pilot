**Dead Reckoning (DR)** navigation is a fundamental aviation technique that allows a pilot to calculate their **current position** based on a previously known position, called a **fix** or reference point.

Unlike GPS navigation, which tells us exactly where we are using satellites, dead reckoning is a process of calculation and prediction. Imagine walking at a constant speed in a fixed direction: if you know where you started and how long you have been walking, you can estimate where you are, even with your eyes closed.

## How Does It Work?

The process starts from a known point and projects the aircraft’s position forward using three key variables:

1. **Elapsed time:** How long the aircraft has flown since the last known position.
2. **Speed:** Specifically, **Ground Speed**, which is the actual speed at which the aircraft moves over the ground.
3. **Heading and Track:** The direction the aircraft is pointing and the actual path it follows.

## Factors Affecting Accuracy

Dead reckoning is not perfect and is subject to cumulative errors. Its accuracy depends on four main factors:

* **Elapsed time** since the last position update (the more time that passes, the greater the potential error).
* The accuracy of **weather forecasts**, especially wind.
* How precisely the pilot maintains **heading** and speed.
* The pilot’s **skill** in navigation techniques.

If the actual wind differs from the forecast (for example, a **crosswind** weaker than expected), the aircraft will drift from its planned route, creating a difference between the estimated position and the real one.

## Basic Rules and Corrections

To maintain control without GPS, pilots use simple mathematical rules and calculation tools:

### The 1 in 60 Rule

This is a golden rule for correcting deviations. It states that **for every 1 degree of drift, the aircraft will be 1 Nautical Mile (NM) off track after flying 60 NM**.

* If a pilot discovers they are off course, they can calculate the **drift correction angle** needed to correct the heading based on the distance already flown and the distance remaining.

### Wind and Its Components

The wind rarely comes perfectly from ahead or from behind. It is broken down into:

* **Crosswind:** Pushes the aircraft sideways, moving it off its route. Pilots use mental rules (such as the “clock rule”) to estimate what percentage of the wind strength is affecting them laterally.
* **Headwind/Tailwind:** Affects speed. A tailwind increases **ground speed** (getting you there sooner), while a headwind reduces it.

### Correcting the Heading

If you have drifted off course, there are methods to return to the route:

1. Calculate the **Track Error Angle (TKE):** How many degrees you are off the intended track.
2. **Parallel:** Turn toward the original route to stop moving farther away from it.
3. **Intercept:** Turn additional degrees to rejoin the original track before reaching the destination.

## Why Is It Still Taught?

In the GPS era, dead reckoning might seem obsolete, but it remains vital for several reasons:

* **Safety (Fail-safe):** It is the ultimate backup method if electronic systems or radio aids fail.
* **Visual Flight:** It allows navigation without relying on external aids.
* **Situational Awareness:** It forces the pilot to constantly monitor wind, time, and fuel, promoting better planning and decision-making.
