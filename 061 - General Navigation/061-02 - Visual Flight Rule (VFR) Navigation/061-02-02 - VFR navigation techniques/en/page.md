Navigation under **Visual Flight Rules (VFR)** is the art of guiding an aircraft using external visual references instead of relying solely on instruments. This article summarizes essential techniques, from how to orient yourself and read maps, to how to handle emergency situations and environmental hazards.

## 1. Basic Orientation Concepts

To know where the aircraft is relative to a point on the ground (a "station"), pilots use several specific angles and terms. Understanding them is key to not getting lost:

*   **Relative Bearing (RBI):** The angle measured clockwise from the aircraft's nose to the station.
*   **QDR:** The magnetic line from the station to the aircraft (known as "Radial").
*   **QDM:** The magnetic heading to fly *toward* the station (opposite of QDR).
*   **QTE:** The true (geographic) direction from the station to the aircraft.
*   **QUJ:** The true heading to fly *toward* the station.

### How to calculate your actual position
Sometimes you need to convert what you see (Relative Bearing) into a real direction on the map (True Bearing). The basic formula is:
> **QTE = RBI + True Heading + 180º**

*Note:* If the sum exceeds 360º, subtract 360. Remember to adjust the magnetic heading with the local **variation** to obtain the true heading before adding.

## 2. Effective Use of Aeronautical Charts (Maps)

The VFR pilot's main tool is their map. The technique consists of relating the symbols on paper with the real world.

### Map Orientation
*   **Track Up (Route upward):** It is recommended to rotate the map to match the flight direction. This improves **situational awareness**: what you see on the right on the map will be on your right in reality.
*   **North Up (North upward):** Better for ground planning or for reading texts and frequencies written on the map.

### Selection of Reference Points (Checkpoints)
Not all objects are useful for navigation. When choosing points to guide you, look for **prominent, distinct, and unique** characteristics.
*   **Good references:** Lakes with defined shapes, wide rivers, paved airports, large highways, and railways.
*   **Poor references:** Small streets in cities (they are all the same), isolated windmills, or unpaved roads without contrast.

Also consider **seasonality** (snow changes the landscape) and your **planned altitude** (flying very low can hide references behind hills).

## 3. In-Flight Navigation and Drift Correction

### What to do if you are delayed?
If you encounter unexpected **headwind**, your **groundspeed** will decrease and you will consume more fuel.
*   If the **Contingency Fuel** (reserve for contingencies) is not sufficient, the safest action to protect your **Final Reserve** is to shorten the route: **turn direct to destination** before the planned point, always informing air traffic control (ATC).

### Quick Distance Calculation
There is a geometric trick using time and angles:
*   If you fly a constant heading and the angle to a station changes, you can use the **isosceles triangle** rule. For example, if the angle changes **45º** in 3 minutes and you flew 9 nautical miles (NM) in that time, then you are exactly **9 NM** from the station.

## 4. Emergency Procedures

### Uncertain of your position?
If you doubt where you are, don't improvise. Follow the **"Position Uncertainty"** procedure:
1.  **Note the time**.
2.  Maintain heading and flight level (don't turn around aimlessly).
3.  **Communicate with ATC** to request help.
4.  Use **radio aids** (such as VOR) if available.
5.  Try the **"Ground to Map"** technique: look for large features on the terrain (mountains, coasts) and try to find them on the map.

### Lost Procedure
If the above fails, you are officially "lost". Look for an unmistakable line (a coast or highway), follow it until you find a known point, and restart navigation. If you have low fuel or are in danger, call **121.5 MHz** (emergency frequency) and declare a **PAN PAN**.

## 5. Hazards and Environmental Conditions

### Night Flight
At night, you only see what is illuminated.
*   **Danger:** Dark terrain is invisible. There is a risk of **optical illusions** such as the "black hole effect," where distant lights appear closer.
*   **Advantage:** Cities and **obstacles with red lights** are very easy to identify.

### Weather and Visibility
*   **Snow and Overcast Sky:** Visual contrast disappears. It is difficult to distinguish the horizon or power lines.
*   **Smoke and Haze:** Factory smoke disperses downwind and can reduce visibility, especially when flying toward the sun.

### Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT)
This is when a pilot flies an aircraft in perfect condition into the ground by mistake. The main cause is loss of **situational awareness** (not knowing where you are). This can occur even during the day if terrain and **contour lines** on the map, which indicate elevation and slope of mountains, are not monitored.
