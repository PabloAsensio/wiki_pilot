# Ground features

VFR navigation is based on identifying **ground features** (ground references) and relating them to the chart. A good VFR pilot chooses references considering their **size, contrast, uniqueness, position relative to the route, flight altitude, season of the year, and lighting conditions**.

---

## Basic concept of ground features

**Ground features** are visible elements on the terrain that the pilot uses to know **where they are**, whether they are **on the correct route**, and whether their **time and speed** match the planning.

Typical examples:

- **Points (checkpoints)**: towns, airfields, lakes, masts, distinctive buildings.  
- **Lines (line features)**: rivers, roads, highways, railways, coastlines, power lines.  
- **Relief**: hills, valleys, mountain ranges.

The key principle is that a good reference point must **stand out clearly** and cannot be easily confused with other similar elements.

***

## Checkpoints: how to choose good points

A **checkpoint** is a **prominent** building or reference point that is easily identified from the air and serves to check position, progress, or time.

### Characteristics of a good checkpoint

A good checkpoint typically meets:

- **Size**: the larger, the better it can be seen from a distance (e.g., **large lakes**, **cities**, **airports**).  
- **Uniqueness**: it must be **unique** in the area (e.g., a **tall isolated mast**, a **large highway interchange**).  
- **Contrast**: it must have a **different color or texture** from the surroundings (e.g., dark pavement against green fields, dark water against snow).  
- **Proximity to the route**: ideally **on the route** or at a short lateral distance.  
- **Appropriate to flight altitude**: at low altitude, **tall** objects are of interest; at high altitude, **extensive** objects are of interest (lakes, cities).

### Good examples of checkpoints

- **Airports with paved runways**: easy to see due to large clearings and contrast.  
- **Railroads (railways)**: stand out due to the clearing they create in the terrain.  
- **Highways** and **large interchanges**: multi-lane highways and cloverleaf junctions are very visible.  
- **Large rivers**: wide rivers, drawn with thickness on the chart.  
- **Large lakes with definable shapes**: large lakes with clear shapes.  
- **Towns with prominent features**: towns/cities with water towers, road or railway crossings.  
- **Tall towers or masts**: tall masts/radio beacons, marked on chart, very visible at low altitude.  
- **High-tension power lines**: with towers and clearings in forests; sometimes with high-visibility balls.

### Poor examples of checkpoints

- **Farmland (cultivated fields)**: low contrast, many similar areas, easy to confuse.  
- **Small woods** or small forests: not unique and change with the season.  
- **Streets within a town**: usually do not stand out; many are similar.  
- **Isolated houses or groups of houses**: the 1:500,000 chart does not represent them in detail and they are easy to confuse.  
- **Small rivers or streams**: represented as thin lines and difficult to see from altitude.  
- **Ranges of all similar hills**: do not offer uniqueness or good contrast.

## Line features: using lines to navigate

A **line feature** is a **clear and continuous** linear characteristic, such as a **river**, **road**, **highway**, **railway**, **coastline**, or even a **power line**.

### Main functions

- **Track control (drift)**:  
  - A line **parallel** to the route (e.g., north-south river when flying north-south) allows checking if we are drifting by maintaining a constant separation.  
  - In reduced visibility, following a **highway** or **river** may be the safest way to arrive without getting lost, even if it slightly increases the distance.

- **Groundspeed and time calculation**:  
  - To measure groundspeed, ideally a line that **crosses the route perpendicularly** (90°), for example a **railway or perpendicular road**.  
  - The pilot estimates the expected time of arrival at that crossing and, in flight, compares the actual time to detect errors in speed or wind.

### Choice according to the situation

- **Good visibility**: a combination of points and lines can be used (masts, towns, intersections + rivers, roads).  
- **Reduced visibility / fog / haze / sun ahead**: it is advisable to simplify navigation and follow **large line features** (highways, large rivers, coastlines) that connect almost directly with the destination.  
- **Low-level flight**: be careful with **power lines**, which are both reference and obstacle; safety margins must be respected.

## Influence of altitude and chart scale

The **flight altitude** and **chart scale** determine which ground features are useful.

### Flight altitude

- **At low altitude (e.g., 1,000 ft AGL)**:  
  - Lakes or towns may be hidden by nearby hills.  
  - Tall objects (a **200 ft mast**, towers, chimneys, very tall buildings) are excellent references.  
- **At higher altitude (e.g., 5,000 ft AGL)**:  
  - Small or low structures lose visibility.  
  - Extensive elements (a **large lake**, a **large city**, a **large industrial area**) are better.

### Chart scale

- A **1:500,000** chart has sufficient detail for general VFR, but **does not show**:
  - Individual houses.  
  - Minor roads.  
  - Fine detail of small hills.  

Therefore, things that **do not even appear** clearly on the chart or that are too small to be usefully represented should not be chosen as references.

## Seasonal and environmental effects

Ground features do not look the same in summer as in winter. The pilot must adapt their references to the **season** and **environment**.

### Snow and winter

With snow:

- **Small roads and railways** may be completely covered and lose contrast.  
- **Forests and fields** become uniform and difficult to distinguish from each other.  
- **Large lakes and wide rivers** may stand out more as dark patches or different in texture.  
- **Coastlines** are especially valuable: their appearance from the air hardly changes with snow and offer a clear line between land and sea.  
- **White-colored** buildings on snowy terrain offer almost no contrast, making them poor references even if they seem important on the chart.

### Other environments

- **Deserts or very homogeneous areas**:  
  - Few natural references; good points are usually airfields, masts, settlements, and large infrastructure.  
  - **Good navigation points may be very far apart**, so this must be anticipated in planning.  
- **Mountainous areas**:  
  - **Valleys** are better references than a simple slope or one hill among many.  
  - **Isolated and prominent hills** are useful; a "range of all similar hills" is not.

## Ground features and night conditions

**Night VFR navigation** has important particularities:

### Night vision and perception

- In low light conditions, primarily the **rods** of the retina work, which **do not distinguish color**.  
- Color differences are very difficult to appreciate; what matters is **light** and **contrast**.  
- It is essential **not to depend on color** to identify ground features at night.

### Night illusions: "black hole" effect

In a night approach over terrain **without lights** (water, desert, dark field) toward an illuminated airfield, the **"black-hole effect"** may appear:

- The pilot perceives a sensation of being **higher** than actual.  
- Tends to fly an approach that is **too low**, risking impact short of the runway.  
- To avoid it, the **published glide slope** or **instruments** must be used and not rely solely on visual sensation.

### Typical night references

At night, the best ground features are:

- **Illuminated airfields** (runways, lighting).  
- **Cities, towns, and industrial areas** with clear lighting.  
- **Illuminated main roads**.  
- **Obstacles with red lights** (tall masts, towers) as a warning, not as the only means to remain clear of terrain.

Although there are good light references, at night it is essential to:

- Maintain **strict instrument discipline**.  
- Know **night illusions** and be prepared to recognize and compensate for them.

## Practical application in VFR planning

When planning a VFR route, the pilot should:

- Choose checkpoints **every 5–10 NM**, clearly identifiable.  
- Prioritize **large, unique features with contrast**, close to the route.  
- Select at least one useful **line feature** (main road, river, coast) to help maintain heading.  
- Consider:
  - **Planned altitude**: tall objects for low altitude, extensive objects for high altitude.  
  - **Season and meteorology**: snow, fog, haze, sun ahead.  
  - **Day or night flight**: at night, focus on illuminated things and use instruments.

With these ideas, **ground features** cease to be simple drawings on a chart and become practical tools to maintain **situational awareness**, avoid disorientation, and navigate safely in VFR.
